			<h1>Syllabus</h1>
			<p>Welcome to E98! We’re here to tell you everything we wish we knew as incoming engineering
			students. E98 is your survival guide to Berkeley Engineering. We’ll share our experiences,
			provide advice, and inform you of strategies and opportunities to help you get the most out of
			your Cal education—and hopefully your life!</p>
			<p>What you can expect from us: As E98 instructors, we’re here to be your friends and help you
			out with whatever issues you might have. Think of us as big brothers and sisters. Questions,
			concerns, thoughts, whatever—don’t be shy to ask us because we were once new to this campus
			and college too!</p>
			<p>What we expect from you: E98 is designed to help you. It’s a course that actually helps you
			with your other classes, and hopefully your life at Cal as well. That said, please take advantage
			of this time to participate in class, listen to your instructors, interact with your classmates, and
			get your questions answered sooner rather than later. Never be afraid to voice your concerns in
			class, as an E98 section is a discussion and not a monologue. We want to get to know you!</p>
			<p><b>Schedule:</b> We meet for one-hour sessions weekly at a time specified by the student’s section.</p>
			<p><b>BCourses Website:</b> <a href="https://bcourses.berkeley.edu">Click Here!</a></p>
			<p>Be sure to visit the bCourses page for class handouts and general resources, and the E98 page for
			instructor bios!</p>
			<p><b>Grading:</b> E98 is a 1-unit pass/no pass (P/NP) course. Grading is based on attendance and on
			homework assignments. Assignments are not graded on a point scale, but marked “acceptable”
			or “unacceptable” - generally, legitimate attempts to complete the homework are considered
			“acceptable”.</p>
			To pass, a student must:
			<ul>
				<li>Miss no more than three (3) lectures</li>
				<li>Fail to turn in an acceptable version of no more than one (1) homework assignment</li>
			</ul>
			<p>When lecturers or homeworks are missed due to unavoidable circumstances, alternate
			arrangements can be made at our discretion. Don’t be shy! Dealing with unavoidable
			circumstances is part of the job. The sooner you contact us regarding issues such as these, the
			better. If something is preventing you from a satisfactory engagement with this course, let us
			know so we can take the appropriate steps to accommodate you.</p>
