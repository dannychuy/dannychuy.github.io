				<p>"I like to think of myself as a potato. I used to think it was a bad thing. Thin veiled covering, I shielded myself from the world and put up a façade for others to see. Nobody buys a potato for the lump of starch; no one takes a potato and bites directly into it. I stand and wait to be mashed, baked, or boiled by others in hopes of being ap-"<div class="bold">peal</div>-ing. I was a side dish to all my friends, a partner to bring along just in case the situation became awkward. No one invited me first; I was just that tagalong friend.</p>
				<p>But then, my friend showed me how great it was to be a potato. Well-rounded, I excelled in all academic subjects. The many trips third wheeling awkward date made me a social expert. Like the potato, I could thrive in any environment, the <div class="bold">lavish</div> and <div class="bold">rich</div> or the <div class="bold">poor</div> and <div class="bold">dry</div>. Eyes all around, I saw each and every side of an argument, the good the bad. And if something caught my eye, I would take the first opportunity to take root and reach for the unknown, making those area(s) of knowledge my own.</p>
				<p>It’s nice to be a potato.</p>
